# einfach

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of einfach is to make collecting tweets through the Academic Research Product Track V2 API as simple as possible. This package is inspired by [Facepager](https://github.com/strohne/Facepager) (Jünger & Keyling, 2019). But the author of this package doesn't have the talent to clone it accurately, and thus **e**infach **i**s **n**ot **F**acepager's **a**ccurate **c**lone, **h**onestly.

## Installation

You can install the development version of einfach from Github with:

``` r
devtools::install_github("chainsawriot/einfach")
```

## Usage

1. You need to have access to the Academic Research Product Track V2 API. Please refer to the [academictwitteR's vignette](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/academictwitteR/vignettes/academictwitteR-auth.html) for more information.

2. Please setup your bearer token using the function `set_bearer()`. You will be prompted for your bearer token. The token will be stored as a hidden file in your home directory by default.

3. Launch einfach

```r
require(einfach)
einfach()
```

4. Use the GUI and enjoy!

### The dumped data

At the moment, this package will only dump the tweet data.

The dumped data is a tibble and look like so:

```{r, include = FALSE}
example <- readRDS(system.file("extdata", "example_data.RDS", package = "einfach"))
```

```{r}
require(tibble)
example
```
