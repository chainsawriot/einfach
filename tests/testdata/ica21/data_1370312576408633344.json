While authenticity on SNS has been linked to increased well-being, most research has investigated it either monolithically (e.g., via screen time measures) or with regard to stable self-presentations (e.g., in Facebook profiles).

Drawing on the affordances approach, we theorize and test whether and how Stories produce greater state authenticity‚Äîa core indicator of eudaimonic well-being‚Äîthan Posts. Results from a preregistered within-subjects study comparing self-reports on N = 489 Posts and N = 546 Stories from N = 202 Instagram users show that by allowing more spontaneous self-presentation, Stories indeed produced (slightly) higher authenticity than Posts.

While authenticity on SNS has been linked to increased well-being, most research has investigated it either monolithically (e.g., via screen time measures) or with regard to stable self-presentations (e.g., in Facebook profiles). In contrast, this study compares state authenticity within users and between self-presentations via two SNS features‚ÄîStories vs. Posts. Drawing on the affordances approach, we theorize and test whether and how Stories produce greater state authenticity‚Äîa core indicator of eudaimonic well-being‚Äîthan Posts. Results from a preregistered within-subjects study comparing self-reports on N = 489 Posts and N = 546 Stories from N = 202 Instagram users show that by allowing more spontaneous self-presentation, Stories indeed produced (slightly) higher authenticity than Posts. However, authenticity was high in both features, further challenging the popular no","unwound_url":"https://psyarxiv.com/jz3wm"}]},"id":"1370312576408633344","author_id":"1280890720098885632","lang":"en","created_at":"2021-03-12T09:55:52.000Z","source":"Twitter for Android","text":"RT @rjkreling: Happy to share that our paper is one of @ICA_CAT‚Äôs Top Papers at #ica21!
