Martin's best-selling book series `A Song of Ice and Fire' is brought to the screen as HBO sinks its considerable storytelling teeth into the medieval fantasy epic. It's the depiction of two powerful families - kings and queens, knights and renegades, liars and honest men - playing a deadly game for control of the Seven Kingdoms of Westeros, and to sit atop the Iron Throne. Martin is credited as a co-executive producer and one of the writers for the series, which was filmed in Northern Ireland and Malta."}},{"domain":{"id":"3","name":"TV Shows","description":"Television shows from around the world"},"entity":{"id":"10028727706","name":"Game of Thrones"}}],"geo":{}},{"attachments":{"media_keys":["3_1397910216344276993","3_1397910268215140353"]},"entities":{"hashtags":[{"start":0,"end":15,"tag":"ICALatinxLatam"},{"start":16,"end":22,"tag":"ICA21"}],"mentions":[{"start":23,"end":37,"username":"SummerDHarlow"}],"annotations":{},"urls":[{"start":161,"end":184,"url":"https://t.co/rAOQeuH4LY","expanded_url":"https://twitter.com/sol_arreguez/status/1397913821474222084/photo/1","display_url":"pic.twitter.com/rAOQeuH4LY"},{"start":161,"end":184,"url":"https://t.co/rAOQeuH4LY","expanded_url":"https://twitter.com/sol_arreguez/status/1397913821474222084/photo/1","display_url":"pic.twitter.com/rAOQeuH4LY"}]},"id":"1397913821474222084","author_id":"1349069792","lang":"en","created_at":"2021-05-27T13:53:21.000Z","source":"Twitter Web App","text":"#ICALatinxLatam #ICA21 @SummerDHarlow spoke about threats to journalists in the digital environment.
